1. Define the Problem and Collect Data
A. Your goal is to measure the semantic similarity or relevance between a question and an answer.
  Collect a dataset that includes:
  A question (e.g., "What is machine learning?")
  A response (e.g., "Machine learning is a field of AI that enables systems to learn from data.")
  A label (e.g., a score from 0-1, where 1 means highly relevant and 0 means irrelevant)
Sources:
  Quora Question Pairs Dataset (for similarity)
  SQuAD Dataset (for answer relevance)
  Manually labeled data
2. Choose an Approach
A. There are multiple approaches depending on complexity:

  (a) Rule-Based Approach (Simple)
  Use TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity:
  Convert text into vectors using TF-IDF.
  Compute cosine similarity between question and response.
  (b) Machine Learning Approach (Moderate)
  Train a supervised model (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) using:
  TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)
  Input: Question & Answer embeddings
  Output: Relevance score (0 to 1)
  (c) Deep Learning Approach (Advanced)
  Use Transformer-based models like:
  BERT / RoBERTa / T5: Fine-tune on a dataset with question-answer relevance labels.
  Siamese Network: Two BERT models process the question and response separately and measure similarity.

3.  Implement the Model
    You can use Python with transformers, sklearn, or tensorflow 

4. Evaluate and Improve
  Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score.
  Fine-tune using labeled datasets.
  Use data augmentation (paraphrasing) to improve robustness.
